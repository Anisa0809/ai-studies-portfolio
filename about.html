<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
I am a postgraduate student enrolled in the PG Cert Artificial Intelligence
programme at the University of Essex Online.
</p>

<p>
My academic background and professional interests are focused on technology,
governance and the responsible use of artificial intelligence in society.
</p>

<p>
This e-portfolio documents my learning journey throughout the programme,
including academic artefacts, reflections, and the development of professional
and analytical skills related to artificial intelligence.
